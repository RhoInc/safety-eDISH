# Interactive Safety eDISH graphic

Evaluation of Drug-Induced Serious Hepatotoxicity, or eDISH, plots are a key tool used to assess liver toxicity in clinical trials. An live demo using sample data is [available here](https://asa-dia-interactivesafetygraphics.github.io/safety-eDISH/test/) and shown below.

## Background

 Standard properties and workflows for static eDish plots are well documented  by [Watkins et al.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165%2F11586600-000000000-00000),  [Merz et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4212156/) and others. This library contains a web-based implementation of the traditional eDISH plot that allows a user to interactively explore participant data in ways that are not possible in static plots. 

## Interactive Functionality

Just like the standard eDish plot, the default view for this chart shows one point per participant with maximal ALT and TB over the course of the study plotted on the x and y axes respectively (see "Population View" below).  Clicking on a participant circle displays additional details for that individual (see "Details View").
